ESP32-C6 + SN65HVD230 CAN Transceiver Wiring Guide
=======================================================

Pin Connections:
----------------
ESP32-C6 Pin  →  SN65HVD230 Pin  →  Description
GPIO0         →  Pin 1 (D)       →  CAN TX (transmit data input)
GPIO1         →  Pin 4 (R)       →  CAN RX (receive data output)
3.3V          →  Pin 3 (VCC)     →  Power supply
GND           →  Pin 2 (GND)     →  Ground
              →  Pin 8 (Rs)      →  10kΩ resistor to GND (slope control)
              →  Pin 7 (CANH)    →  CAN High line
              →  Pin 6 (CANL)    →  CAN Low line

Additional Components:
----------------------
1. 100nF ceramic capacitor between VCC (pin 3) and GND (pin 2)
   - Place as close as possible to the transceiver

2. 10kΩ resistor from Rs (pin 8) to GND
   - Enables high-speed mode with ~15V/μs slew rate

3. 120Ω termination resistor between CANH and CANL
   - Required at BOTH ENDS of the CAN bus
   - If testing with 2 devices, both need terminators

CAN Bus Wiring:
---------------
Device 1 CANH  ────────────── Device 2 CANH
               |             |
             [120Ω]        [120Ω]
               |             |
Device 1 CANL  ────────────── Device 2 CANL

Common GND between all devices is REQUIRED!

Testing Setup:
--------------
For initial testing:
1. Connect Rs pin to GND via 10kΩ
2. Add 100nF cap at VCC
3. Install 120Ω terminators at both devices
4. Connect CANH to CANH
5. Connect CANL to CANL
6. Connect all GNDs together

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- No communication: Check termination resistors (120Ω)
- Unreliable: Check decoupling capacitor (100nF)
- Bus errors: Verify Rs pin is connected (10kΩ to GND)
- Random failures: Check all GND connections
